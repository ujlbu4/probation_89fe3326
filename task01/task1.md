### Task 1

Imagine the following situation: you are joining a cross-functional team which builds a front-end application using REST APIs. You are a first QA engineer and need to establish a QA process in the team.
1. What would you do in your first few days of work? Where would you start?
2. Which process would you establish around testing new functionality?
3. Which techniques or best practices in terms of code architecture and test design would you use in your automated tests?



##### Possible Approaches

Usually when I join a new team or project I try to define the current situation. At first there are two essential things, first one is to define goals and other requirements for this project, second one is to have a meeting with each member and stakeholder to recognize their expectations, attitudes, experience and other flavors. 

Upper-level Action plan usually looks likes as follow: 
- define the goals
- explore the project
  - functional requirements
  - non-functional requirements
  - architecture and integration components
  - infrastructure
  - team
  - current processes
- relationship with team members
  - developers
  - management / stakeholders
  - other qa engineers
- prepare a roadmap 
  - share with team and management
- QA
  - quality metrics
  - testing levels
  - functional requirements
  - processes
  - release management
  - ci/cd
  - infrastructure as a code
  - monitoring
