### Task 1

Imagine the following situation: you are joining a cross-functional team which builds a front-end application using REST APIs. You are a first QA engineer and need to establish a QA process in the team.
1. What would you do in your first few days of work? Where would you start?
2. Which process would you establish around testing new functionality?
3. Which techniques or best practices in terms of code architecture and test design would
you use in your automated tests?

### Task 2

How would you approach test automation of an HTTP API of some service? 

Choose a service from this list ​https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis ​or any other of your choice. It is better to pick one without authorization as it is easier to test.
Document several test cases. Implement one or two automated tests based on the test cases. Write the tests as if they were a part of a real project.
