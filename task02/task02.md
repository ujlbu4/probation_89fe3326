### Task 2

How would you approach test automation of an HTTP API of some service? 

Choose a service from this list ​https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis ​or any other of your choice. It is better to pick one without authorization as it is easier to test.
Document several test cases. Implement one or two automated tests based on the test cases. Write the tests as if they were a part of a real project.
